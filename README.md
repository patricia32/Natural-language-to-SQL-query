# Natural-language-to-SQL-query

This is a coverter from natural language to SQL queries with SELECT, CREATE, DROP, DELETE, ALETR clauses. I developed it using LEX and YACC, the main things in this project are the tokens and regex expressions. At the end of Yacc file I wrote some examples of inputs which the code provides SQL queries for.
